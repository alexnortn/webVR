Asset Management System

A-Frame has an asset management system that allows us to place all of our assets in one place and to preload and cache assets for better performance.

Games and rich 3D experiences traditionally preload many of their assets, such as models or textures, before rendering their scenes. This makes sure that assets aren't missing visually, and this is benifial for performance to ensure sences to don't try to fetch assets while rendering.

Assets are placed within <a-assets>, and <a-assets> is placed within <a-scene>
Assets include:

	+ <a-asset-item> = Miscellaneous assets such as 3D models and materials
 	+ <audio> - Sound files
 	+ <img> - Image textures
 	+ <video> - Video textures

The scene and all entities will block until all of these types of assets are fetched (or error out) before playing.
