What is A-Frame?

A-Frame is an open-source WebVR framework for creating virtual reality (VR) experiences with HTML. We can build VR scenes that work across smartphones, desktop, the Oculus Rift, and the room-scale HTC Vive.

	+ Build what would have once been a complex web app with simple HTML markup.
	+ Speed (native) vs Accessibility + Usability (WebVR)
	+ A-Frame is a three.js framework that brings the entity-component-system pattern to the DOM
	+ Everything in a scene is an entity which we compose and attach components to add any appearance, behavior, and functionality.


<a-entity> 

Represents an entity, attributes represent components, and attribute values represent component properties. Components can do anything. Say someone publishes a physics component and someone else publishes an explode component. We can compose them together and attach them to the entity to add the behavior of exploding collision.

	+ Get a simple figure going for this.
	+ This feels a lot like Angular :)
	+ MVC --> A-Frame --> three.js --> webGL

A-Frame was build by the Mozilla VR team to make it quicker and easier to build 3D/VR scenes in order for them to prototype faster and to bridge the web development community into the WebVR ecosystem.

	+ For WebVr to succeed, it needs content.

There are only a handful of WebGL developers in the world, but there are millions of web developers, designers, and artists. A-Frame pust 3D/VR content creation into the hands of everyone.


A-Frame reduces boilerplate

Without A-Frame, starting a proper WebVR project is a lot of effort. You need to know what you are doing and repeat the same tedious work for every scene.

	+ <a-scene>
	+ Rather than creating a mesh, creating geometry, creating a material, then appending to scene, that is all also reduced to a single line of HTML.


Intergrating with existing web frameworks

	+ d3
	+ React
	+ Vue.js
	+ Meteor
	+ jQuery

"A-Frame is like when MVC landed in traditional front-end work...[where] three.js is like jQuery" â€“@wizrav

	+ Referring to Model View Controller --> Angular

Three.js had made it very accessible to develop webGL, but three.js code is often loosely structured. A-frame provides a way to structure three.js code.

A-Frame is a declaritive entity-component system framework for three.js

Developers can modularize three.js and Javascript code within A-Frame components. These components can be composed with one another. If published and shared, these componenets can be used by other developers via HTML.

	+ We're designing web applications, not websites.
